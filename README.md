## Quick start

Note: Open two terminal windows, execute `yarn rsw watch` in the first and `yarn tauri dev` in the second. The order of execution is important, do not close the first window!

```bash
# 1. Do not exit the process after the command has started.
yarn rsw watch

# 2. Front-end: start dev server
yarn tauri dev
```
